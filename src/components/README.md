Crazy Button
============

The crazy button accepts props and slotted content (from within a react context).

Markdown is used to build up documentation however you want.

```html
<CrazyButton>Oh no! I can't be edited.</CrazyButton>
```

If you want to create the editable code sections with live updates, simply use
the `js` or `jsx` flag on the code formatted section.

Here is one example

```jsx
<CrazyButton text="What's wrong with Jeff?"></CrazyButton>
```

**But that's not all.**

Here is *yet another* example!

```jsx
<CrazyButton>
    <span className="something-to-describe-me">Somethings up with Toady McToadface!</span>
</CrazyButton>
```

I don't believe it.
